# Object-Oriented Solar System in Processing

Welcome to this guide on creating a basic solar system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Processing. This tutorial offers a gentle introduction to OOP concepts using a visual and engaging topic.


## What is OOP
<br>
OOP is a paradigm in programming where we model our program structure around "objects" rather than procedures. These objects contain data (attributes) and can perform actions (methods).

<summary>What is a Class?</summary>

In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. For our solar system, we'll think of each planet as an object, and they will be created from the `Planet` class. This is the class provided to you. You will almost never code from a blank slate, save for research and school :)

While looking, write down 3 questions you have.

Here, the <em>Planet</em> class has attributes (like <em>radius</em> and <em>distance</em>) and methods (like <em>show</em> and <em>update</em>).

Lets break this down step-by-step by adding new methods and attributes!

## Create Objects

<details>
<summary>Instantiating Objects from the Class</summary>

With our class defined, we can create objects, which are instances of this class.

Here, we've created two objects: `sun` and `earth` from the `Planet` class. This is what we mean by Instance of an object, or instantiate an object.

## Use Objects

<details>
<summary>Using Methods of the Object</summary>

Each object can use the methods defined in the `Planet` class.

In this segment, we call the `show` and `update` methods for both the `sun` and `earth` objects.
