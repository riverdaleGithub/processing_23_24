# Object-Oriented Solar System in Processing

![Swarm Solar System](swarm.gif)

Welcome to this guide on creating a basic solar system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Processing. Dive into the wonders of OOP concepts while exploring the vastness of the universe.

## 🌟 Introduction to OOP 🌟

OOP revolves around the idea of designing programs based on "objects". These objects hold data (attributes) and are capable of performing actions (methods).

### 🌍 Step 1: Understanding Classes 🌍 

In the world of OOP, a class is the blueprint for objects. For our solar system, we'll treat each planet as an object, crafted from the `Planet` class. Remember, most of the time you're working with existing templates.

While exploring, jot down 3 questions you have, and spot a method and an attribute.

Notice how the `Planet` class contains attributes (e.g., `radius`, `distance`) and methods (e.g., `show`, `update`).

### 🚀 Step 2: Crafting Planets 🚀

With our class in place, let's bring to life some celestial objects.

Behold! We've just manifested two cosmic entities: `sun` and `earth`. These are instances (or objects) of our `Planet` class.

### 🔭 Step 3: Interacting with the Cosmos 🔭

Unleash the power of our celestial objects.

Watch as the `sun` and `earth` respond to our command, utilizing methods from the `Planet` class.

### 🎨 Step 4: Final Checks & Challenges 🎨 

Before you launch, ensure you've:

1. Created 3 instances of the planet class.
2. Utilized 3 unique methods.
3. Showcased the artistry of your solar system.
4. Embedded the science behind your design.
5. Crafted a new method in the `Planet` class to make planets move.
6. Introduced a fresh attribute to the `Planet` class.
7. Incorporated user input.
8. Employed conditional statements.
9. Outlined your TODO list for the next session (hint: steps 9-10).
10. Computed the gravitational force between a planet and the sun using their real-life masses.
11. Transformed step 10 into a new method, but only after tackling step 9.
