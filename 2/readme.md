# 🌌 Solar System in Processing 🪐

Hello budding astronomers and programmers! Let's embark on an interstellar journey to create a static solar system today. And don't worry, soon we'll make those planets revolve! 🚀 First, you should click on the gif below to decide which phase of our solar system you are going to simulate. Before moving on, you must have your idea/plan peer reviewed by three other students!

 The `ellipse(400, 300, 100, 100);` function draws the sun. The first two values set the position (x,y), and the last two values set the width and height of the ellipse.
