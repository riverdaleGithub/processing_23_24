# 🌌 Solar System in Processing 🪐

Hello, budding astronomers and programmers! Let's embark on an interstellar journey to create a static solar system today. And don't worry, soon we'll make those planets revolve! 🚀 First, you should click on the gif below to decide which phase of our solar system you will simulate. Before moving on, you must have your idea/plan peer-reviewed by three other students, and you will be asked to explain the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/translate_.html"> `translate(x,y)` function</a>

## 🛠 Setting Up

<details>
    <summary>Install Processing</summary>
    <br>
    1. Get the IDE
    - Visit <a href= "https://processing.org/download/"> Processing's download Page</a>
    - Install and launch Processing. It's like our spaceship control room!

   2. **Ensure You're in Java Mode**:
    - Processing uses Java by default. Just ensure you see 'Java' in the top right.

  <summary>🌟 Hint: Troubles installing?</summary>
Make sure you have the right version for your operating system. If you get stuck, ask a classmate or your teacher for help.

<details>
<summary>🌟 Hint</summary>
    
"The `size(800, 600);` sets our universe's width and height. Feel free to make it bigger or smaller!"

<details>
  <summary>🌟 Hint</summary>
   
 The `ellipse(400, 300, 100, 100);` function draws the sun. The first two values set the position (x,y), and the last two values set the width and height of the ellipse.

You already have been making flow charts and using conditionals! here is a basic condition in java!

## 🪐 Step 🐁: If & Input
Look up and add user input and a conditional to your program :) 

<details>
  <summary>🌟 Input Hint</summary>
    Input is the first thing I think about. What data does the program need? Check out this link to see how processing allows a programmer to create interactive works of art!

  <summary>🌟 If/Else Hint</summary>
   If statements in Java are the same as in every language. The only change is in the structure of the words, i.e., syntax.

## 🪐 Step 5: Add All Planets

Can you add the moons, asteroid belts, or scale planet sizes? Soon, we will make this
solar system spin :)
