# MileStone One

Think of a milestone on the road: it marks how far you've come and signals towards the journey ahead. Similarly, your Milestone Project is a significant marker in your coding adventure. It's a comprehensive assignment designed to showcase all the skills you've acquired so far, especially your newfound ability to create and use functions.

Functions are like magic spells in Java. You've learned to conjure these spells to perform tasks, from the simplest to the more complex. They help you organize your code, avoid repetition, and make your programs more efficient and easier to read.

In this project, you will be tasked with creating a program that is a reflection of both your creativity and your technical skills. Here's what it's all about:

# Grading

<h2>Creating Functions(🛠️) </h2>
You will design your own functions from scratch. Think about what tasks you want to perform repeatedly in your program and encapsulate them within functions.
<br>
 

<h2>Using Functions(📲) </h2>
 Once you've created your functions, you'll call them at the right moments. This will test how well you can integrate them into your program to perform useful actions.
<br>


<h2>Structuring Programs Functionally(🏗️)</h2>
 Your program should not just be a jumble of code. It should have a clear, logical structure where functions are used to break down problems into manageable pieces.
<br>


<h2>Focus(🎯)</h2>
This Milestone Project is not just about getting a good grade. It's about putting your skills to the test and building something you can be proud of. It's about thinking like a programmer and solving problems systematicall
